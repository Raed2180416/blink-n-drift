# Blink & Drift

A fun, camera-powered lane-switching game where **you** steer with your finger, blink to ramp up difficulty, pinch to start/pause/restart, and collect items to manage your spawn rate and lives.

## 🚀 Features

- **Blue‐circle “freeze” collectibles**: slow down spawns when caught  
- **Hearts**: regain one life when collected after you lose one  
- **Lives system**: you start with 3 lives; crash into obstacles to lose them  
- **Score & Highscore**: dodge obstacles to increase your score; your best run is saved  
- **Pinch gestures**:  
  - **Pinch to START** at the title screen  
  - **Pinch to PAUSE / RESUME** mid-game
